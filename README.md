# Michael Pöttgen

Hi, my name is Michael Pöttgen. I'm a software development manager and former professional software developer. I still love to write code every once in a while. I've started to contribute to open source projects (e.g. [NDoc][ndoc]) on [SourceForge.net][sf] at a time where GitHub or `git` were not even invented yet. In the meantime I've developed an interest in quite a range of different technologies. And every once in a while I still try to contribute a little bit to various projects.
